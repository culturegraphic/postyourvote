    li Most of our data is sourced from the #[a(href='https://docs.voteamerica.com/api/') VoteAmerica Election API]. VoteAmerica is a nonprofit organization providing access to trusted election information.
    li We maintain an #[a(href='https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invOvJEQEAhZV646w&inviteToken=5826433648becba241ae4463becce0c0798baab7896e9c8bdb5628fa55be6a1d') independent Airtable dataset] that includes our “best guess” recommended dates for when to expect to receive ballots, and county-level rules for relevant states. So no matter where you live in the US, we’re doing our best to provide you with the most accurate and most localized information possible.
